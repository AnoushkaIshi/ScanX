    Based on the AI analysis, the following conditions might be considered:
    
    1. **Cardiac Abnormality**
       - Common symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue
       - May be associated with structural or functional changes in the heart
       
    2. **Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**
       - Coronary artery disease
       - Cardiomyopathy
       - Valvular heart disease
       - Congestive heart failure
       - Arrhythmias
    
    ** Recommended Follow-up:
    
    1. **Additional Imaging:**
       - Echocardiogram for detailed cardiac structure and function
       - ECG/EKG for electrical activity
       - Cardiac stress test to evaluate exercise capacity
       
    2. **Laboratory Tests:**
       - Complete blood count
       - Cardiac enzymes (troponin, CK-MB)
       - BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide)
       - Lipid profile
       
    3. **Specialist Consultation:**
       - Cardiology referral for comprehensive evaluation
    
    ** Important Limitations:
    
    This analysis is generated by an AI system with limited information. A proper diagnosis requires:
    - Complete patient history
